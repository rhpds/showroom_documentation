== Overview

Welcome to the showroom .git template repo for writing your demos, workshops, labs and other content.
From this point onward we will use the term *demo* to refer to all types of content but please read this to include: lab, demo, course etc.
By template, we mean that this repo has everything needed for you to start writing, and testing, your demo content.

== Getting to first "render"

To render the pre-built demo content in your browser, follow these steps:

. `./bin/showroom`  # Assumes you have an installed and running container runtime
. Browse to link:http://localhost:8888[localhost:8888]

That's it, you should see a rendered page n your default browser with the sample demo content.

NOTE: There is no need to install any other software on your local machine. All the tools you need are provided in the `bin` directory. There is *no need* for node, npm, asciidoctor, gulp etc.

=== Getting Started

This repo contains, by design, minimal documentation.
The definitive, and up-to-date, documentation can be found at https://redhat-scholars.github.io/build-course[https://redhat-scholars.github.io/build-course].

The following is a quick start guide to get you started.


* link:documentation/modules/ROOT/pages/01-setup.adoc[Working Directory]
* link:documentation/modules/ROOT/pages/02-structure.adoc[Structure]

==== Prerequisites

Minimal, you need to have the following installed:

* git
* An editor of your choice

NOTE: For live local rendering of your demo, you will need to install a container runtime such as `podman`` or `docker`.
That's it.

Advanced developers can if they wish leverage underlying features inherited from the upstream Antora project such as using `gulp` to live render the project locally. Howver the `bin` directory provides similar functionality via the `showroom` cli leveraging the showroom live render container image.
